Hey there, budding coders and OpenSource enthusiasts of IIT Mandi! 🚀

Ever wondered why ants work together? No, it's not because they have tiny FOMO. It's because they realize that by working together, they can achieve so much more than by working alone. That's exactly why we want every single one of you to contribute to the CodeForge Repo this HacktoberFest! 🐜🍁

Why? Because together, we can create a robust codebase that will not only be an epitome of our combined coding prowess but also help all of us learn and grow. Imagine having a repository, by the IITians, for the IITians, helping us solve the daily coding blues for our college.

### Guide to Get You Started 🚀:


- **Set Up Your Workspace and check out the "Issues" tab**🖥️: Before diving in, ensure you have a development environment set up. If you’re new, consider using a platform like Visual Studio Code, which is versatile and user-friendly.


- **Fork the Repository**🍴: Head over to Code-Forge Repository and click on the "Fork" button. This creates your own copy of the repository.

- **Clone Your Forked Repository** 📥: On your forked repository, click the "Code" button and copy the URL. Then, in your terminal or command prompt, type `git clone URL`. Replace _URL_ with the link you just copied.

- **Create a New Branch** 🌿: Always make your changes in a new branch. This keeps things organized and avoids potential conflicts. Use the command `git checkout -b branch-name`.

- **Make Your Changes**✍️: Dive into the code, make your valuable contributions, and save the changes.

- **Commit and Push** 🚀: Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message. Use git add . followed by `git commit -m "Your message here"`. Then push the changes to your forked repo using `git push origin branch-name`.

- **Open a Pull Request** (PR) 📤: Go back to the original Code-Forge Repository and click on "New Pull Request". Select your fork and the branch you worked on, then submit the PR with a clear description of your changes.

- **Wait for Review** 👀: We will review your PR and might ask for some changes or improvements. Make sure to check your notifications!

- **Celebrate Your Contribution** 🎉: Once your PR gets merged, give yourself a pat on the back. You've contributed to the IIT Mandi community, and that's a big deal!

**📌 General Guidelines for Contributing:**

- Clean and Readable Code: Remember, someone else will be reading your code. Or you might be reading your code six months down the line and wondering, "What sorcery is this?"

- Comment When Necessary: Not everything in life needs an explanation, but your complex code snippets sure do.

- Avoid Duplication: Before pushing a new algorithm or application, ensure that it doesn't already exist in the repository.

- Stay Relevant: Make sure your contributions stick to the theme – DSA, ML Algorithms, or applications to visualize/implement these algorithms.

**🚫 What Can Lead to PR Rejection:**

- Plagiarism of any kind.
- Submitting someone else’s work.
- Incomplete or broken code.
- Ignoring the general guidelines mentioned above.

Let's make this HacktoberFest memorable! Not just for the swag or the need to plant some trees for the planet, but because it’s a testament to what we can achieve together.

Let’s code, laugh, learn, and may the source (code) be with you! 🚀🎉

With 💙 from Akarshan & Biswadeep, your fellow IIT Mandi code-lovers!
